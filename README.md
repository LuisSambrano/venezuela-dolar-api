## 🏛️ Project Abstract

This repository contains the source code for a real-time exchange rate dashboard. Built with **React 19** and **Vite**, the application consumes public endpoints to display currency pair metrics. The architecture is optimized for minimal rendering overhead and stable layout calculation, providing an efficient continuous data-stream visualization layer.

## ⚙️ Core Technical Features

### 1. Real-Time Data Synchronization

Implementation of polling mechanisms to fetch JSON streams from the DolarAPI. Includes caching strategies to minimize network saturation while maintaining updated metrics for multiple exchange rates (parallel, official, crypto).

### 2. Rendering Optimization

Engineered to prevent React Commit Phase blocking. The interface implements CSS hardware acceleration strategies (transform-gpu) replacing expensive filter operations (like backdrop-blur) with solid opacity alternatives, resolving potential thermal throttling on high-resolution displays.

### 3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) Mitigation

Zero layout shift engineering through exact-geometry skeleton loaders, ensuring the DOM tree remains immutable during the data fetching lifecycle.
