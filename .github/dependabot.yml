# Dependabot configuration — Antigravity Standard
# Strategy: Auto-update patches & minors only. Major versions are closed
# and handled manually in dedicated migration sessions.
#
# Jules handles security audits. Dependabot handles dependency freshness.
# Together they keep the repo healthy without breaking changes.
